# Setup 
When setting up for the first time, run the `setup.sh` script to create the virtual environment with all dependencies:

```
./setup.sh
```

Then activate the virtual environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

After the initial setup, only activation of the virtual environment with the above command is required.
